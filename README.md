# This is a collection of works I created during my studies at Politechnika Pozna≈Ñska university

After Google Drive Sync tool had destroyed some of my files, I sought shelter in Git. Fortunately only some of my `.tex` files died.

This was meant to be a private repository, but should someone find these useful, I don't mind sharing under **CC0**.

If you want to use these as a shortcut, you're only hurting yourself. But to be perfectly honest, there is no point in doing something, we are not keen on. *The thing is, society wants us to be obedient and want marks to grade us upon that...*

*At least be smart about it.*
